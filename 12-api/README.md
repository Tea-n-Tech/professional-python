# API

This lesson is about designing APIs with Python.
To be more exact, we will be focusing on the famous REST APIs.

## Abstract Principles

REST (Representational state transfer) is not a specific way of implementing an
API as largely confused, but it is guiding principles so you don't fuck up.
If you follow the principles you will get the following properties:

- (Horizontal) Scalability
  - Spawning multiple instances increases performance
  - Interaction with offer components is efficient
- Simplicity
  - The interface is concise and understandable
  - Offer only what is needed
- Modifiability
  - The interface (specs) can be extended and changed
  - The API can be extended functionally
- Transparency of communication
  - It is clear and simple to understand who communicates with who
- Portability
  - Moving the application to another machine is easily possible
- Reliability
  - Failure of API instances does not affect the entire system

These properties make limited sense to just the single component but if you add
eventually a database and other systems around their sense becomes stronger.
To get to these REST defines the following architectural constraints:

1. Clientâ€“server architecture
   - Separate server internals such as the database from the client
     interface
2. Statelessness
   - No storing data between requests within the API instance
3. Cacheability
   - Allowing traffic to be cached at several levels greatly
     increases system performance  
4. Layered system
   - The system can be put behind other layers such as network
     load balancers or proxies
5. Uniform interface
   - Simple usage and decoupling of different system components
   - Resource identification in requests
     - Different routes target different resources
     - Response formats can be varied (XML, JSON, HTML, ...)
   - Resource manipulation through representations
     - Clients can modify resources with minimal interactions
     - Update attributes (through e.g. a post request)
   - Self-descriptive messages
     - Message headers specify the data type and encoding info
   - Hypermedia
     - Links in the response can direct the client to other
       resources
6. Code on demand (not used here)
   - Load additional code extensions on demand

These formal principles hit rather hard as before once you consider
the API as a piece with other components.
Note if you don't stick to these principles you will loose previous
properties.
For example if you store data between requests within the API instance
you loose scalability since parallel running instances are not
possible as they would have different knowledge about clients.

## Network, Protocol and other Shenanigans

Networking has a lot of layers but we won't go into that here as it is a book
on its own.
All you need to know for the moment is, that almost the entire communication
you will deal with is based on TCP/IP (or in rare cases UDP).
On top of that usually starts the fun with different protocols.

### HTTP

If you don't deal with fileservers (FTP) or emails (IMAP) you will most likely
end up with HTTP as workhorse or rather its bigger extension HTTPS.

Just as general info for sparing some pain, HTTP has three major versions.
The first one is super simple but limited in performance.
The second one relies on multiplexing to speed things up, but as you guess it
also got more complicated.
While HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 rely on TCP underneath, HTTP/3 relies on QUIC, just that
you heard the names.
As you guessed, HTTP/3 provides drastic performance improvements thanks to QUIC
and other changes.
In message headers, the clients usually define the standard they use and offer.
So in case your performance is f...bad you might want to check which HTTP
version is used and served.

HTTP provdes different methods to interact with resources:

- GET
  - As you guessed this method gets a resource, website or file
- POST
  - Submits a resource entity to change to the server
- PATCH
  - Submits a partial modification of a resource entity
  - Rather rare encountered as POST is mostly offered already
- PUT
  - Uploads an entirely new resource entity and possibly replaces an existing
    entity
- DELETE
  - Obiously delete a resource enitity
- HEAD
  - Do a get request but just ask for the header
  - Helpful to get information about the payload such as how big it is to check
    for storage

There are more but for simplicity, these are all you will need for a long time.
So anytime you want to interact with a resource you do this through these
methods.
For example a GET on `../users` gives you a list of all users but a DELETE
will remove a specified user (if permissions match).

Another thing actually important to know are HTTP codes.
Pleae don't learn them like at school, but be aware of the ranges.
A few will stick after a while ... trust me.

- 1XX Information (very rarely encountered)
- 2XX Success
- 3XX Redirection
- 4XX Client errors
- 5XX Server errors

You will be mostly dealing with responses in the 2XX, 4XX and maybe sometimes
5XX range.
Some of the most important codes are:

- 2XX
  - 200 Ok (with payload)
  - 201 Created
  - 204 Ok (no payload)
- 3XX
  - 301 Stuff Moved
  - 304 Not Modified (caching fun ...)
  - 307/308 Redirection
- 4XX
  - 400 Bad Request (client sent a malformed request)
  - 401 Unauthorized (this fellow will haunt you)
  - 403 Forbidden (another friend you will see often
  - 404 Not found 
  - 418 I'm a teapot
  - ... a lot more but you will meet them eventually
- 5XX
  - 500 Internal Server Error (Something is broken)
  - 502 Bad Gateway (Networking is screwed)
  - 503 Service Unavailable (Another bad day fellow)

### HTTPS

Nowadays no one does HTTP really anymore.
The reason is that HTTP is entirely unencrypted so everyone between you and the
receiver in the internet can read and manipulate the message.
Yeah it is really bad.
This goes so far that even traffic within a companies microservice architecture
is entirely encrypted.

#### What is it briefly put?

HTTPS is the safe version of HTTP by using TLS (or SSL) to encrypt requests.
Why will you hate HTTPS as a developer?
Certificates are a blessing for security but a big pain for development.
Many companies have expiring certificates after 1 or 2 years and often there
is not yet an automated way to exchange these.
I saw many companies where services went down from time to time just because
no one payed attention to the certificates.
Another pain point is handing certificates around such as including them in
docker images etc.
Not that it all is hard but "just" adding certificates often complicates things
by a lot.
Nonetheless don't even think about going HTTP.
Just accept it and do the job.

#### How does it work in short?

Certificates in its largest form have three participants.
A certificate authority (CA), public key certificate (CRT) and private key
(PEM).
The authority is a certificate widely distributed.
For example your browser has CA from a lot of companies such as google.
A customer of a CA can ask to give them a CRT and PEM ... often against money.
Therefore they send them once a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
These companies then create a CRT for you but you can also use
[Let's Encrypt][lets-encrypt] which does it for free and there are tools to
renew certificates automatically.
Once you have a CRT and PEM you can install it in your service.
Note the PEM must stay with you!
If someone visits your website or API, they retrieve your CRT and can verify
cryptographically if a CA such as google created the certificate.
By this they know if you are truly legit or just a fake.
I won't go into detail here but your communication will be encrypted from then
on.
A little note, you can also create just a CRT and PEM and forego a CA which is
sometimes a use-case for use-cases with limited scope where a CA is not present.

## More Protocols ... JSON, HTML and others

On top of HTTPS usually starts the action.
You could send plain text now but we want to exchange data and data always has
a format and that is most definitely not excel or something related.
Responses most commonly return:

- Text-based:
  - HTML/JS/CSS (websites)
  - JSON
  - XML
  - Base64 (bytes encoded as strings)
- Media
  - Images (jpeg, ...)
  - Videos (mp4, webm, ...)
- Binary
  - Plain files (blob)
  - Protobuf
  - Cap'n Proto
  - Flatbuffers
  - ...

Most APIs you will encounter usually work with JSON although XML is presumably
more common thanks to e.g. banking.
Base64 is nothing else but bytes encoded as a string.
Emails often do this to encode appended content.
Note text-based formats are extremely inefficient to put it friendly.
It is dangerous to say this generally, but you can expect lower performance
and higher memory usage compared to binary protocols.
Why is this important?
Because especially ingress and egress (traffic) is very, very expensive.
You will recognize it on your AWS bill quickly.
Protobuf from Google is maybe the most famous binary protocol out there.
It is not the most efficient but has a very good sweetspot, a large support in
languages, many tools surrounding it and is well-established.
There are still faster alternatives such as flatbuffers but they are less
popular and suffer from related problems so don't go into those rabbit holes
if you don't need it.

## Frameworks

Let's get finally to business.
As expected, there are a lot of frameworks.
The most famous ones are probably [FastAPI] and [Flask].
Having used both, I can generally recommend FastAPI.
You will have a great experience with it.
It is quite fast for a Python API and the comfort of using it is very very good.
So lets install it:

```console
poetry add fastapi uvicorn[standard]
```

Note that we build the API with FastAPI but it will be served by [uvicorn].
Before we can interact with our data we need some first.
Data is never held inside the API (stateless!) but within a database.
Nonetheless this is a tutorial so lets fake a real database.
To do this we create a file `deathstar/database.py`:

```python
from abc import ABC
from typing import Dict, Union
from pydantic import BaseModel


class Planet(BaseModel):
    """Class with information about the planet"""

    name: str


class PlanetDatabase(ABC):
    """This class represents a generic planet database interface"""

    async def get_planet(self, name: str) -> Union[Planet, None]:
        """Get a planet from the database

        Args:
            name: Name of the planet to retrieve
        """
        raise NotImplementedError()

    async def remove_planet(self, name: str) -> bool:
        """Removes a planet from the database

        Args:
            name: Name of the planet to remove
        """
        raise NotImplementedError()


class FakePlanetDatabase(PlanetDatabase):
    planets: Dict[str, Planet]

    def __init__(self):
        # Create fake data
        self.planets = {
            "alderaan": Planet(name="Alderaan"),
            "tatooine": Planet(name="Tatooine"),
            "naboo": Planet(name="Naboo"),
            "tython": Planet(name="Tython"),
            "dantooine": Planet(name="Dantooine"),
            "yavin4": Planet(name="Yavin4"),
        }

    async def get_planet(self, name: str) -> Union[Planet, None]:
        return self.planets.get(name.lower())

    async def remove_planet(self, name: str) -> bool:
        name = name.lower()
        if name in self.planets:
            self.planets.pop(name)
            return True

        return False
```

Be aware of a few explicit things:

- We define a generic interface description with `abc.ABC` to make sure
  we abstract away the concrete implementation underneath.
  With this we could easily add a real database interface underneath.
- We use `pydantic.BaseModel` to define the `Planet` class.
  `pydantic` comes along with `fastapi` and helps to serialize or deserialize
  the class instances so we can simply return them in the API as you will see
  later.
- Recognize how we return a `bool` if a planet was removed in case of
  success or how we return `None` if a planet did not exist.
  This is important since you will see later a resource is not found, which
  is a planet here, we will notify the user with a HTTP 404 (Not Found).

Now it is API time baby, lets create a file `deathstar/api.py` with the
following content:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, status

from .database import FakePlanetDatabase, Planet


app = FastAPI()
db = FakePlanetDatabase()


@app.delete("/api/v1/planets/{target}", status_code=status.HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT)
async def destroy_planet(target: str):
    """Shoot a laser at a planet

    Args:
        target: Planet name to destroy
    """
    success = await db.remove_planet(target)
    if not success:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
            detail=f"Planet {target} does not exist",
        )


@app.get("/api/v1/planets/{name}", response_model=Planet)
async def get_planet(name: str) -> Planet:
    """Get info about a planet

    Args:
        name: Name of the planet
    """
    planet = await db.get_planet(name)
    if planet is None:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND,
            detail=f"Planet {name} does not exist",
        )

    return planet
```

Again here are a few important things to realize:

- The basic route is `api/v1` which allows us to revamp our api entirely
  under a new version without breaking other peoples systems who interfaced
  us.
- We use `DELETE` method for destroying a planet.
  If the planet is not found we return a classic 404 and in case of success
  it is a 204 (No Content) since destroying a planet speaks for itself.
- The route resource type is the planet name.
  Imagine for destroying a planet we could also make a `POST` method on
  for example `/api/v1/planets/{target}/destroy` but this is bad practice since
  the route should describe a resource or be close to it.
- When retrieving a planet we define `response_model=Planet` which allows us to
  simply perform `return planet` without having to convert the class manually
  into a proper response type such as JSON.
  Really Sweet.
- All functions so far were defined `async` which roughly put allows things to
  run more efficiently in parallel (I most definitely won't go into this but
  parallelization and Python including the GIL are a huge topic on its own).
  Different threads could basically then handle multiple requests in parallel
  (I feel very bad having to put it like that cause in Detail things don't go
  exactly like that).

## Running the Code

To run the API we could use a `main` in a module file but we already have a cli.
So it makes sense to add another cli command to start the api.
For complex API servers it is common to write a cli either eating flags such
as port number of for more complex cases consuming a server config file usually
written in yaml.
Therefore we add a file `deathstar/cli/api.py` with the following content:

```python
import typer
import uvicorn

from ..api import app

api_cmd = typer.Typer(name="api", invoke_without_command=True)


@api_cmd.callback()
def run_api(host: str = "0.0.0.0", port: int = 8080):
    """Starts the API server"""
    uvicorn.run(app=app, host=host, port=port)
```

Now we can run our API with `poetry run deathstar api` but to remember that
command we add it to our `Taskfile.yaml`:

```yaml
# ...

  api:
    desc: Run the API server
    cmds:
      - poetry run deathstar api

# ...
```

Now we can do `task api` to run our API server.
Doing so yields the following output:

```console
task api
task: [api] poetry run deathstar api
INFO:     Started server process [29334]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

Really nice!

## Manual Testing

We've all been there that we needed to test an endpoint manually.
Even if it is just for figuring out how something works.
There are a lot of tools to perform HTTP requests.
[Postman], [HTTPie] and many more.
Your best friend on Linux will still be `curl`.
Why?
Since it is available everywhere and even if you won't use it to probe APIs
then you will use it somewhere when automating processes in a script.
Thus I will go with `curl` here but fele free to choose any tool you like for
the following step.
Now let's run our API with `task api` and try a query:

```console
$ curl localhost:8080/api/v1/planets/alderaan
{"name":"Alderaan"}
```

Looks good.
Let's try an unknown planet and use the verbose flag to see more details:

```console
$ curl -v localhost:8080/api/v1/planets/123
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1) port 8080 (#0)
> GET /api/v1/planets/123 HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:8080
> User-Agent: curl/7.81.0
> Accept: */*
> 
* Mark bundle as not supporting multiuse
< HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
< date: Wed, 30 Nov 2022 21:12:13 GMT
< server: uvicorn
< content-length: 38
< content-type: application/json
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
{"detail":"Planet 123 does not exist"}%   
```

Sweet.
We get a 404 and a reasonable error message.
Trust me how important good API error messages are.
Everyone encounters at least once in a lifetime one of those APIs who just
return a 400 (Bad Request) when perform a complex query and you have no clue
what to fix.

## Integration Testing

You have been using unit-tests so far.
Another testing type you should know or at least know by name is integration
tests.
To put it simple, this test just runs API requests against the API and checks
if the responses are sound.
They can be performed in any way, through a Python script itself but also
through `curl`.
We don't perform integration tests here since this is just too small code.
If things get bigger though it makes sense to create some.

## Documentation and OpenAPI Specs

FastAPI is amazing since it creates a route `localhost:8080/docs` which
renders the API specs.
Originally if you write API specs, this is done in OpenAPI which is a json/yaml
file format to describe an API (see `localhost:8080/openapi.json`).
FastAPI can generate this automatically from the code and render it as docs
page.
From the docs you can run queries!
Such a useful thing to have, for users and development.
Check it out.

## Authentication and Authorization

This topic is a bomb, that is why we won't try it out here.
Authentication means whether someone is allowed to use something (login) and
authorization means whether someone has an access attribute which allows
them to access certain data (e.g. data about a private GitHub repo).

Authorization is performed by either username and password or more common
through an API token.
Tokens are better since they have limited scopes and can be revoked or have a
limited lifetime in multiple ways.
When performing a request with authorization, this information is most commonly
put into the request header.
Usually the key of the field is `Authorization` (wow who would have thought)
and the value is `<type> <token>` where type is one of the following:

- Basic (base64-encoded credentials such as passwords)
- Bearer (more common, a token to access OAuth 2.0-protected resources)
- Digest (based on SHA-256)
- ...

You most commonly will encounter `Bearer` or maybe sometimes even `Basic`.
A typical header would then look for example as follows:

```text
Authorization: Bearer f8f7929hf2gh114
```

How the hell do we get this into our Python app?
Usually you do this through a so called middleware.
Users, similar to the GitHub API, authenticate once with often username and
password to retrieve an API token.
This token is then used for other requests.
The reason why this is not fun is we need at least something to validate
username and password and if we are lucky also something handling the tokens.
And that is exactly the point where a billion solutions unfold which are very
diverse in the API universe.
You can use a vanilla LDAP to authenticate users for example but then you still
need to handle the tokens.
Another solution is to go with an external solution such as 1Password or AzureAD
which often have integrations for FastAPI.
Nonetheless they often do their own thing underneath so it is hard to give a
general guide to this.
You will most definitely hate it but enjoy the pain.
If your company is low on engineering money, go with an external Provider.
They are very safe, know what they do, price is often reasonable and you will
save a lot of engineering and nerves.

## The Road to HTTPS

Our API runs solely in http as you noticed.
How do we run it with HTTPS now?
You could get certificates either through a company or
[let's encrypt][lets-encrypt] and incorporate them into the API directly but
this is not recommended.
Usually your API will be behind a so called ingress controller or load balancer
anyway.
This ingress controller can be configured with HTTPS so that they take care of
it.
The most typical solution for this is of course [NGINX].
It is incredibly powerful but simple too.
The Let's encrypt bot also works with nginx as described
[here][nginx-lets-encrypt].
Be aware another solution relies on the classic Apache HTTP server but NGINX
is definitely a better choice.

Configuring ingress with NGINX and with HTTPS is a delicate but helpful thing.
At your job you will work a lot with certificates so any kind of exercise is
recommended.
Simply buy a RaspberryPi or rent a cheap little server and deploy a real Python
API.
For a toy server I can recommend [Strato](strato.de/) but it is a german
provider.
Cheap servers [cost around 6 Euro a month][strato-offer] with unlimited network,
100MBit Bandwidth, 400GB SSD and 2 vCPU (2022) but you need to rent it for at
least two months.

## Note on APIs

As you may realize APIs are an extremely broad topic.
We tried to touch the important aspects here.
Nonetheless you will need a lot of excercise to really master them.
After getting better now in Python see this as another topic to face.
If you really want to get deeper into programming to get better jobs I can
also recommend to do this in another language such as golang after
toying around in Python for a while.

## Performance

To make it brief, APIs with python are not exactly efficient compared to other
languages such as golang or rust.
Nonetheless they are easy and fast to create, and if built right you can simply
compensate the lack of performance with more instances running in parallel.
In the end you will pay more but for many if not most companies this cost is
not really an issue.
The bigger issue is usually the cost of maintainability of python.
